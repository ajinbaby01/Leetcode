#
# Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return the
# reversed list.
#
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
# Output: [5,4,3,2,1]
#
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: head = [1,2]
# Output: [2,1]
#
#
# Example 3:
#
#
# Input: head = []
# Output: []
#
#
#
# Constraints:
#
#
# The number of nodes in the list is the range [0, 5000].
# -5000 <= Node.val <= 5000
#
#
#
# Follow up: A linked list can be reversed either iteratively or recursively.
# Could you implement both?
#
#

# @lc code=start
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def reverseList(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        # Iterative
        # prev = None
        # while head != None:
        #     next = head.next
        #     head.next = prev
        #     prev = head
        #     head = next
        # return prev

        # Recursive
        if not head or not head.next:
            return head
        node = self.reverseList(head.next)
        # node = 5, head = 4
        head.next.next = head
        head.next = None
        return node
